# Object Oriented Programming
This repository contains a file that demonstrates examples of each of the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming. Below is a brief summary of these pillars:

## The Four Pillars of OOP
### Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which is achieved through access modifiers like private, protected, and public.

### Abstraction:
Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It helps in reducing complexity and allows the programmer to focus on interactions at a higher level.

### Inheritance:
Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.

### Polymorphism:
Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It allows methods to do different things based on the object that invokes them, typically achieved through method overriding and interfaces.
